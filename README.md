# What to do & Why?
You have been asked to create a form to gather data using JavaFX.  It should allow the user to enter the information and check to see if the data is valid.  Once the data has been validated, save the information as a line in a comma separated value file. After the data has been save, clear the form so that that next person can enter their data.
# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references

# How to do it?
Using the example programs in the module, construct the GUI data entry form.

Upon completion of this assignment, you will have demonstrated the following:

Your ability to create a GUI form that uses text entry fields.
Your ability to validate data.
You ability to add data to a .csv file.

# What to submit?
Submit your fully tested, commented, and documented Java source code files.
